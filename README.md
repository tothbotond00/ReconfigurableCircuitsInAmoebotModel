# ReconfigurableCircuitsInAmoebotModel

The amoebot model [Derakhshandeh et al., 2014] has been proposed as a model for programmable matter consisting of tiny, robotic elements called amoebots. We consider the reconfigurable circuit extension [Feldmann et al., JCB 2022] of the geometric (variant of the) amoebot model that allows the amoebot structure to interconnect amoebots by so-called circuits.
A circuit permits the instantaneous transmission of signals between the connected amoebots. In this paper, we examine the structural power of the reconfigurable circuits.

## Example use
